/**
 * TODO
 *
 * The protocol for "rendering elements".
 * 
 * When parsing a Mustache template, GRMustacheCompiler builds a syntax
 * tree of objects representing raw text and various mustache tags.
 * 
 * This syntax tree is made of objects conforming to the
 * GRMustacheRenderingElement.
 * 
 * Their responsability is to render the data provided by the library user. This
 * data is encapsulated into GRMustacheRuntime objects, which represent a
 * context stack that grows when entering a Mustache {{#section}}, and shrinks
 * when leaving that same {{/section}}.
 * 
 * For instance, the template string "hello {{name}}!" would give four rendering
 * elements:
 *
 * - a GRMustacheTextElement that renders "hello ".
 * - a GRMustacheVariableElement that renders the `name` key in a context.
 * - a GRMustacheTextElement that renders "!".
 * - a GRMustacheTemplate that would contain the three previous elements, and
 *   render the concatenation of their renderings.
