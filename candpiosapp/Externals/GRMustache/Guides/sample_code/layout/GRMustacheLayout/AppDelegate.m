     * The application ships with three templates:
     *
     * - layout.mustache: the base structure for a HTML page.
     * - header.mustache: a partial template that renders a HTML header.
     * - article.mustache: the content of a specific "article" page.
     *
     * All of those want to access the rendered data. Precisely speaking,
     * layout.mustache needs to fill its <title> HTML tag; header.mustache needs
     * to fill its <h1> HTML tag; and article.mustache needs some text to be
     * displayed.
     *
     * header.mustache is embedded as a partial into layout.mustache, with the
     * {{> header }} tag, because all pages have a header.
     *
     * However, article.mustache is not embedded as a partial, and we do not
     * want it to be.
     *
     * This is because Mustache partials are always harcoded. Since we would
     * like to use layout.mustache with some other templates like, say,
     * author.mustache, video.mustache, or whatever, Mustache partials are not
     * the solution.
     *
     * No problem: we'll render our document in two passes:
     *
     * - the first pass will render the embedded content with article.mustache.
     * - the second pass will fill the {{{ embeddedContent }}} tag of
     *   layout.mustache with this embedded content.
     *
     * Is the plan clear? Let's start by defining the rendered data:

     *                  "embeddedContent" key, so that the layout template can
     *                  find it and perform its layout job.
     * 
     * - article:       so that the layout can render the article's properties.
